in this project i assess the data using GAN it learn patterns directly from the data.
i use No2 column which contains No2 pollution values.
gan has 2 parts generator and discriminator
they both improve the data 
generator makes fake data from real numbers
while discriminator checks if data is fake or real
after training generator was used to create many samples.
histogram of these samples were plotted.
gan can learn data distribution without using any fixed mathematical formula.
